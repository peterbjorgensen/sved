*sved.txt*  Synctex-based synchronisation between VIM or Neovim and evince.

INTRODUCTION                                    *sved*

SVED is a Vim plugin enabling synctex synchronization support for Vim and
Evince through DBus. It provides
 - |sved-forward-search|: a function to highlight the current buffer
   line in evince
 - |sved-backward-search|: When you hit <C-LeftMouse> in evince, the cursor
   will automatically move in VIM to the matching location in the buffer.

DEPENDENCIES                                    *sved-dependencies*

SVED requires:
 - VIM 8+ or Neovim
 - python3 on the path with the modules pygobject3, dbus-python and neovim
 - Evince 3.0+

Your latex file must be compiled with synctex support. This can be done by
compiling your project with `pdflatex -synctex=1 main.tex` . This should leave
a `main.synctex.gz` file in the main directory. If automatic detection of this
file fails, you can also create an empty file named `main.tex.latexmain`
alongside your `main.tex`.

FORWARD SEARCH                                  *sved-forward-search*

Forward search is provided by the following function:
                                                *SVED_Sync*
SVED_Sync()
  Highlights the current buffer position in evince.  If the file is not yet
  opened by evince, a new window will be opened for it.

  You can map this function to a keybinding of your choice, for example: >
    nmap <F4> :call SVED_Sync()<CR>
<
BACKWARD SEARCH                                 *sved-backward-search*

<C-LeftMouse> in Evince will make Vim jump to the corresponding location in
the buffer. If the file is not yet open, a new buffer will be created for it.

TROUBLESHOOTING                                 *sved-debug*

To debug the dbus bridge process, export the `SVED_DEBUG` environment variable
before starting VIM. A log file will be created in the current working
directory.
